    A diligent, hard-working second-year student studying Computer Science with Software Engineering (BEng Hons) at the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">University of Sheffield</a>, looking to secure a Software Engineering related Summer Internship or similar to pair with my enthusiasm for the subject. Keen to maximise the opportunity to test and further my current programming and software development skills in the context of an actual workplace.
